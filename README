tested with MacOS with Homebrew
$ brew install sbt  (0.13)
$ brew install scala (2.10.3)

tested with vanilla Debian stable with Vagrant:

$ wget http://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/sbt-native-packages/org/scala-sbt/sbt/0.13.0/sbt.deb
$ dpkg -i sbt.deb (0.13)
If the image has very little memory SBT might fail.. use the -mem flag to reduce memory

Wil pick up correct scala version, specs, mockito...
Also added sbt-idea to help manage specs with IntelliJ
$ sbt update
